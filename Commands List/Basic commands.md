## How do I initialise a repo?
Create a folder, lets say cats for example. Navigate to that folder in terminal.

Type in:
```
git init
```
## Creating a file?

Use touch command to create a file.

```
 touch file1.txt
```
#### Note: New files are in untracked state first.

The phases go as follows.

>   ### Untracked > Staged > Committed> Pushed to Github
